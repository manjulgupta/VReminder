### what to do for sms logic:
- muliple vaccines in a day??
- codebase strong enough to perform tests later on, after a code edit
- how to handle vaccines of past? whether to leave them pending or mark them done?
- mechanism to collect if the patient is vaccinated or not

### security:
- 3rd person must not be able to hit anything except login page
- closing all testing endpoints

### in .env
- route link is sourcecd from .env; need to update that later
